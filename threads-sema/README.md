# Overview

Included in this directory are a number of skeletal code fragments, which you
can fill out to solve various synchronization problems. 

And see Allen Downey's book, "A Little Book of Semaphores", for even more
fun. It's also free!

To compile any one of them (say, one called `foo.c`):

```sh
prompt> gcc -o foo foo.c -Wall -pthread
```

And then, to run it:

```sh
prompt> ./foo
```

(maybe with some optional arguments)
