# Overview

There are now two simulators related to this chapter. The first,
`fork.py`, is a simple tool to show what a process tree looks like
when processes are created and destroyed. Read more about it
[here](README-fork.md).

The second is a program, `generator.py`, that creates real C programs
that use `fork()`, `wait()`, and `exit()` to show how `fork` works in
running programs. Read more about it [here](README-generator.md).
